# TOONLIST COMMAND REFERENCE
# STOP: # <=== THIS IS A HASHTAG. 
#   A hashtag as the first character of a line MAKES IT A COMMENT.
#   THAT MEANS INVISIBLE AND UNUSED.
#   YOU DO NOT USE HASHTAGS IN YOUR TOONLIST.TXT ON YOUR LINES.
#
#   In the sample toonlist.txt I give you, I have everything commented out.
#   YOU need to change and uncomment lines you want to use.
#
#
# NOTE: Except for passwords, capitalization DOES NOT MATTER HERE
#
# Format is <command> <command arguments>
# Elements with spaces in the name must always be quoted
# Some arguments are lists in quotation marks.
# Capitalization is always ignored, EXCEPT ON AUTODELETE LIST OR itemto list!
# Commands:
# "#" as the first character in a line is a comment. 
# Comment lines will be ignored. You can use comments for clarity.

# Box makes a window line in your HKN file which will log one toon in.

# Raidlist is a single letter to assign the toon to when you open your raid
# Can be a list of letters in quotes.
# "m n z a l g"
# If you are using multiple computers, add a number after raidletter to set
# which computer the toon pops on. (no number means Local computer or cpu 1)
# "m1 n2 z1 a l1 g1"
#
# What letter you assign them to will be which ctrl-alt-letter in HKN will pop
# that raid.
# They will appear on the monitor in order of the box commands.
# In the example above, eversmile will appear in the alt-ctrl-M raid, the
