# This is your toonlist--it contains your info for each account.
# Make a box command for each window you want to open.
# FORMAT:
# box <wowaccount> <password> <name of toon> <role> <one or more raidletters>
#
# role can be tank / hunter / melee / caster / healer
# 
# raidletters are what letters you want to pop those toons on.
# Example, ctrl-alt-m pops all toons by default
# if you put a t after your tank (shown), ctrl-alt-t will pop him only.
# toons can be members of any number of raids.
# 
# For running multiple computers, see the video on youtube.

# extrawait1 and extrawait2 are new keywords that allow you to control the
# timing of window opening if you find that windows aren't getting populated
# with passwords and accounts properly or that the windows are strangely logging
# into the wrong account. Start with the numbers shown. They are milliseconds,
# and you can tune them for whatever works.
# extrawait1 is a pause between opening wow and renaming the window.
# extrawait2 is a pause after the window is renamed but before trying to
insert password/account
